-- tests/test_lintconfig.lua — the "no blanket suppression" gate (lint-§1, `M4-11`).
--
-- WHAT IT PROVES. That `luacheck .` reaching 0/0 in this repository is a statement about the code
-- and not about the configuration. Four things are checked, and all four are the same rule seen
-- from a different side:
--   1. `.luacheckrc` sets no top-level `ignore`.
--   2. It switches no warning class off wholesale, which is `ignore` spelled as a switch.
--   3. Every `ignore` it does set sits in a `files[...]` stanza that is narrow — the key names one
--      `.lua` file, or the entry names the variable as well as the code (`212/self`).
--   4. No tracked `.lua` file carries a bare inline `-- luacheck: ignore` with no code after it,
--      which is the same blanket wearing a different hat.
--
-- WHY IT EXISTS, in this repo specifically. `.luacheckrc` carried
-- `ignore = { "212/self", "212/event", "211/addonName" }` through the whole 2026-09-07
-- remediation, and the exit pass found it. The entries were already in `<code>/<variable>` form,
-- which is what made it easy to leave alone — but the SCOPE was the whole repository, and
-- `M4-11` is about scope: an ignore that silences the wall reads as coverage and provides none.
-- With the line removed, `luacheck .` reported SIXTEEN findings, and ELEVEN of them were not
-- conventions at all — eleven files opened `local addonName, NS = ...` over a folder name they
-- never read. All eleven are gone from the source as of `M4c-06` rather than re-parked in a
-- narrower suppression, and the five that remain are receivers a calling convention forces,
-- named file by file. A twelfth thing the blanket hid was that one of its own three entries,
-- `212/event`, matched nothing in this addon and never had.
--
-- Removing the line is one afternoon's work. Keeping it removed is what this file is for.
--
-- WHY IT READS THE CONFIG AS LUA RATHER THAN AS TEXT. `.luacheckrc` is a Lua chunk, and a text
-- scan for `ignore` is defeated by any of the half-dozen ways Lua has of writing the same
-- assignment. Loading it under a sandboxed environment gives back the same table luacheck itself
-- builds, so what this gate reads is what luacheck obeys. The environment auto-creates a table on
-- first index because `files["tests/"] = { ... }` is written without declaring `files` first,
-- which is how luacheck's own config loader behaves.
--
-- IT FAILS RATHER THAN PASSES WHEN IT CANNOT LOOK. No `.luacheckrc`, an unreadable one, a chunk
-- that will not compile or will not run, no `io.popen`, no git — every one of those is a failure,
-- not a skip. A gate that goes quiet when it is blind reports success, which is worse than not
-- existing. Same bargain tests/test_layout_cap.lua and tests/_kit/test_eol.lua strike here.
