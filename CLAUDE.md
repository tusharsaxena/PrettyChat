# CLAUDE.md — Ka0s Pretty Chat

**Ka0s WoW addon.** Adheres to the **Ka0s WoW Addon Standard** —
https://github.com/tusharsaxena/WowAddonStandards

## Standards compliance (read first)

This repo is built to the **Ka0s WoW Addon Standard**
(https://github.com/tusharsaxena/WowAddonStandards). All development here — features, refactors,
doc changes — MUST conform to it. The standard is the source of truth for layout, TOC shape, the
Ace substrate, schema-driven settings, slash/prefix conventions, locales, Compat, tests/lint, and
doc structure.

**If a change would deviate from the standard, STOP and flag the deviation explicitly.** Do not
silently deviate and do not silently "fix" to match. Surface it and let the user decide which of
two things it is:

1. **An accepted deviation** — this addon intentionally differs; record it as a row in
   `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → `## Documented deviations`, shaped
   `| Rule | What differs | Why | Decided | Re-check trigger |`, where Rule is the `filename-§N`
   reference. That register is the single home: the reasoning may live in the issue-audit GitHub
   issue or an audit bundle and the row cites it, but a deviation not in the register is not ratified.
2. **A change to the standard itself** — the standard's definition should evolve; the update
   belongs upstream in the WowAddonStandards repo, after which this addon conforms to the new rule.

When in doubt, treat standard conformance as a hard requirement and ask.

Start here, then read the docs:

- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — what this addon is: module map, namespace publishing, invariants,
  the vendored-library adoption, audit history, working environment, the documented deviations, and
  the `## Documentation map` listing every page under `docs/`.
- **`docs/testing.md`** — how to verify: the headless harness, lint, the green gate, the vendor-sync
  gate and the test-case inventory.
- **`DEPENDENCIES.md`** (root) — what to install to build, run, test or release this addon.
- Topic detail in `docs/` — Tier 1 is always present (`scope.md`, `module-map.md`, `schema.md`,
  `settings-panel.md`, `data-flow.md`, `common-tasks.md`); the Documentation map lists the rest.

Green gate before every commit: `lua tests/run.lua` and `luacheck .` (0/0). Never auto-stage/commit/
push and never bump the version without an explicit instruction.
